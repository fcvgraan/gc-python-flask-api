The free tier is quite generous so it won't cost you anything.

The SDK offers platform agnostic functionality via CLI (Command Line Interface). The script deploy.sh will create a new Google Cloud project
with default settings and deploy the Python code in this project as a cloud function running with Python 3.7

The script will generate output in terminal that contains details regarding the successfully deployed function, including
httpsTrigger. This is the url endpoint you need to call to test the API.
